Google Reader Reimagined
========================

#### About ####

'Google Reader Reimagined' is a simple webapp/tool I did in a weekend's time in order to help me deal with my endless list of feeds in Google Reader

It currently supports ClientLogin to the service (I will add oAuth in the next build) and gives you the option to define some terms (words or sentences e.g. blizzard, world of warcraft, javascript etc) that you care the most in order to prioritize the stories containing those terms.

It also has a 'mark as read' functionality (added today) in order to remove the articles you read.
